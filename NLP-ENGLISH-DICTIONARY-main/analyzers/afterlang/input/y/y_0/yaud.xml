===Etymology===
From {{inh|en|enm|}}. Originally used to mean &quot;mare&quot;, then &quot;old mare&quot;. From {{der|en|non|jalda||mare}}, from a {{der|en|urj|-}} language, such as {{der|en|mdf|эльде}} or {{der|en|myv|эльде}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thorson&quot;&gt;Per Thorson, ''Anglo-Norse studies: an inquiry into the Scandinavian elements in the modern English dialects'', volume 1 (1936), page 52: &quot;Yad sb. Sc Nhb Lakel Yks Lan, also in forms ''yaad'', ''yaud'', ''yawd'', ''yoad'', ''yod(e)''.... [jad, o] 'a work-horse, a mare' etc. ON ''jalda'' 'made', Sw. dial. ''jäldä'', from Finnish ''elde'' (FT p. 319, Torp p. 156 fol.). Eng. ''jade'' is not related.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Saga-Book&quot;&gt;''Saga Book of the Viking Society for Northern Research'', page 18: &quot;There is thus no etymological connection between ME. ''jāde'' MnE. ''jade'' and ME. ''jald'' MnE. dial. ''yaud'' etc. But the two words have influenced each other mutually, both formally and semantically.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
This term influenced and was influenced by {{m|en|jade}}, but is considered etymologically distinct by some references,&lt;ref name=&quot;Thorson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Saga-Book&quot;/&gt; while others consider the two terms to be variants of one another.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Partridge, ''Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary of Modern English'' {{ISBN|1134942168}}, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
