|passage=Fandom is a wonderful thing. We used to live in Florida ten years ago. Across the street lived a lad two years older than '''yed''' who had the most wonderful collection of comic books...all of a [[stf]] nature. At the ripe old age of eight '''yed''' was swept to Georgia and the lad with the comics was never heard from. Since entering fandom we thought much of him and wondered if he were not a [[slan]]. This morning we learned that he is a member of NFFF and TFSC. Naturally we got a letter off to him.

|passage=In preparation for this momentous occasion '''yed''' has been browsing past issues of this sterling journal, and it has come to our attention that previous articles by yhos have been devoted largely to bemoaning the multitude of technical problems encountered in production -- the difficulties of duplication, the miseries of mimeography.
