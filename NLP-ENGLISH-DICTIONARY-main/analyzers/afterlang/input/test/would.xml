====Usage notes====
* As an [[auxiliary verb]], {{m|en||would}} is followed by the bare infinitive (without {{m|en|to}}):
*: ''John said he '''would''' have fish for dinner.''
* {{m|en||Would}} is frequently contracted to {{m|en|'d}}, especially after a pronoun (as in {{m|en|I'd}}, {{m|en|you'd}}, and so on).
* The term ''[[would-be]]'' retains the senses of both desire and potentiality (those of ''[[wannabe]]'' and ''[[might-be]]'', respectively).
* Indicating a wish, {{m|en||would}} takes a clause in the past subjunctive (irrealis) mood; this clause may or may not be introduced with {{m|en|that}}. Most commonly in modern usage, it is followed by the adverb ''[[rather]]'', as in ''I '''would''' rather that he go now''. A call to a deity or other higher power is sometimes interposed after {{m|en||would}} and before the subjunctive clause, as in '''''Would''' to God that {{...}}''; see [[Citations:would|the citations page]] for examples.
* When used, mainly archaically, in the sense of &quot;if only&quot;, the first-person subject pronoun is often omitted.
====Synonyms====
* (''indicating an action in the past that happened repeatedly or commonly''): [[used to]]
* (''used to express a polite request''): [[be so good as to]], [[kindly]], [[please]]
====Translations====
'''''Note''': many languages express some meanings of '''would''' using a [[mood]] or [[tense]] rather than by a particular word.''
