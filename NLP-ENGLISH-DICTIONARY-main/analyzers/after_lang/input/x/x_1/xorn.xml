{{en-noun|s|xorn}}
{{wikipedia|Xorn (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)}}
# {{lb|en|fantasy}} A [[fictional]] [[monster]] that devours [[earthen]] and [[silicate]] materials and can move freely through [[earth]].

#*: Various monsters can tunnel through rock - either humanoid monsters with picks or rock eaters like rock moles and umber hulks; and some monsters like '''xorns''' and ghosts can pass through it without digging.
#* '''2007''', &quot;bear&quot;, ''Makes Lovely Julienne Ogres....'' (on newsgroup ''rec.games.roguelike.angband'')
#*: Teleporting from an open room where there were a dozen black orcs firing bows at me and more pouring in through both doors a few nights ago didn't work the first two times, then when it did work it landed me, low on mana and hitpoints, in a room full of gnome mages who instantly summoned four umber hulks and a '''xorn'''!
#* '''2010''', Roger Bourke White, ''Rostov Rising: The Tales of Baron Rostov'' (page 229)
#*: That afternoon, I summoned a '''Xorn'''—an earth elemental noted for its speed—and asked it to scout the caves of the Dragon's lair for me.
