[[File:Blommendae, Reyer Jacobsz. van - Xantippe Dousing Socrates - c. 1655.jpg|thumb|{{w|Reyer van Blommendael}}, ''Xantippe Dousing Socrates'' ({{circa2|1655|short=yes}}).{{ref|group=n|name=n1|From the collection of the {{w|Musée des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg}} in [[Strasbourg]], [[France]].}} It depicts an [[angry]] {{w|Xanthippe}} [[dump#Verb|dumping]] the [[contents]] of a [[chamber pot]] over {{w|Socrates}}, who is supposed to have responded, “After [[thunder#Noun|thunder]] comes the [[rain#Noun|rain]].” Her name is now used to refer to an [[ill-tempered]] [[woman]].]]
===Etymology===
{{root|en|ine-pro|*ḱas-|*h₁eḱ-}}
Borrowed from {{bor|en|la|Xanthippē}} or its {{glossary|etymon}} {{bor|en|grc|Ξανθίππη}}, the name of {{w|Socrates}}’ [[wife]],&lt;ref&gt;{{R:OED Online|entry=Xantippe|pos=n|id=230976|date=1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; from {{m|grc|ξανθός|t=blond; golden, yellow}} (ultimately from {{der|en|ine-pro|*ḱas-|t=blond; grey; white}}) + {{m|grc|ἵππος|t=horse}} (ultimately from {{der|en|ine-pro|*h₁eḱ-|t=horse; swift (?)}}). She is described as [[shrewish]] in {{w|Xenophon}}’s ''[[w:Symposium (Xenophon)|Symposium]]'', though the same work states that Socrates chose her precisely because of her argumentative spirit. In Xenophon’s ''[[w:Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia]]'' and ''{{w|Phaedo}}'' by {{w|Plato}} she is depicted as a devoted wife and mother.
