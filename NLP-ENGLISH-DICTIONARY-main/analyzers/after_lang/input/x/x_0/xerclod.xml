===Etymology===
Alteration of &quot;piece X&quot; read upside down.
===Noun===
{{en-noun}}
# {{lb|en|rare}} A [[parallelogram]]-shaped [[connector]] in a [[model]] [[rocket]] assembly.
#* '''2000''', &quot;Scott D. Orr&quot;, ''Re: Questions about Boost Glider Boosts [Again--Someone answer, please!]'' (on newsgroup ''rec.models.rockets'')
#*: There could be some side-to-side movement, because the piece the glider fuselage was cut from is actually a bit narrower than the piece the pod pylon was cut from (and I think the '''xerclod''' is a bit narrower than the fuselage, though I've built that part up with tape).
#* '''2000''', &quot;Rhhickok&quot;, ''Re: Motor mount burn through'' (on newsgroup ''rec.models.rockets'')
#*: Each side of the BT-60 had 2 '''xerclods''' (short lengths of 1/8&quot; dowels) to hang the gliders on.
#* '''2002''', &quot;Bob Kaplow&quot;, ''RMR FAQ part 8.2 Free Flight Boost Gliders [long]'' (on newsgroup ''rec.models.rockets'')
#*: Some sort of positive hook is needed, yet it must be designed to separate easily at ejection. Once{{SIC}} common method is the &quot;Piece X&quot; or '''xerclod''' hook, where a rhombus hook is cut from the fuselage and attached to the pop pod.</text>
