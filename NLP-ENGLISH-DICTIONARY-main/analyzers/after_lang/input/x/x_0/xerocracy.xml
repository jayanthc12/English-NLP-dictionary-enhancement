Hundreds of thousands of copies of the letter were distributed in Iran. As a Tehran University professor put it [in October 1978]: &quot;We were struggling against autocracy for democracy, by means of '''Xerocracy'''.&quot;}}

[...] '''Xerocracy''' is thus not only a means of shaping participant and public perceptions of about bicycle transportation (through facts, statistics, images, and personal narratives); it is also a part of a larger communicative shift, where cyclists take ownership of, and responsibility for, the meaning of the event.}}
