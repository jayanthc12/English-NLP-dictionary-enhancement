Cultures across English |author=Ofelia Garc√≠a &amp; Ricardo Otheguy |year=1989 |page= |ISBN=3110848325 |passage=The &quot;other dialect&quot; may not need a special term for it, since it is the structurally unmarked, frame-of-reference variety which may be taken as defining that which is &quot;normal&quot; in the '''xenolect''' as well. But were a term to be needed for the non-xenolectal dialect(s), an appropriate one might be matrilect, making up as it does the matrix in which a '''xenolect''' is embedded. }}
