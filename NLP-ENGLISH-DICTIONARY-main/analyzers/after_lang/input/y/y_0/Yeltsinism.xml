# {{lb|en|disapproving}} the political and economic policies of {{w|Boris Yeltsin}}, after he became the effective ruler of [[Russia]] following the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]] in December 1991
## the outward appearance of democracy, while actually concentrating power in a form of authoritarianism
##* '''2000''', Mohamed Sid-Ahmed, Al-Ahram Weekly, Issue No. 464, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070514221053/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2000/464/op3.htm Putin's impossible equation]'':
##*: It thus seems that the 'constitutional coup' brought about a ''''Yeltsinism''' without Yeltsin', a surgical operation that aimed at prolonging the life of '''Yeltsinism''', even if this entailed the removal of Yeltsin himself and the institution of measures against the corruption and nepotism that had gone beyond all limits in his immediate entourage.
## the economic and social chaos as a result of the decline of the authority of the Russian state
##* '''2015''', Stephen Kotkin, Foreign Affairs, CFR, ''[http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/143037/stephen-kotkin/the-resistible-rise-of-vladimir-putin The Resistible Rise of Vladimir Putin]'':
##*: All the while, a bogeyman served him well—not a return to communism, Yeltsin’s scarecrow, but the chaos of '''Yeltsinism'''.
