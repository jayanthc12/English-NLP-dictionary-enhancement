====Usage notes====
* ''&quot;Yamukunaun... yeteme natu...&quot;'' is the time-honored opening phrase of formal oratory delivered, usually at dawn or dusk, by the principal chief to the community at large. When used in chiefly oratory in this way, only the plural form, '''''yamukunaun''''', is used, never the singular '''''yamukutai'''''.
* Because Wauja of all ages are customarily enjoined to comply with the wise advice of their elders, the chief's orations gain added authority when he addresses the entire village as his juniors. Of course, he can do this only if they actually ''are'' his juniors, which happened to be the case during Chief Walakuyawatumpa's tenure during 1981-83, and for some years before and after.
