==Spanish==
===Etymology===
{{unk|es}} origin, perhaps from whimsical slang by youth. A prevailing theory, given the term's ultimate origin in [[Aragon]] and [[Catalan]]-speaking territories, is derivation from {{bor|es|ca|jajo||grandpa}}. It seems the first form generated was {{m|ca|*jaja||grandma}}, from which the masculine form was derived. This would come from {{der|es|ca|avia||grandmother}} (from {{der|es|VL.|*aviōla}}, feminine diminutive of {{m|la|avus||grandfather}}), and from juvenile [[palatalization]] would generate something like {{m|ca|*ai̯a}}. The common phenomenon of syllabic repetition in children's language (cf. {{m|en|papa}}, {{m|en|baba}}, etc.) would then cause the form {{m|ca|jaja}} above, which would then be spread into Spanish and masculinized.
Otherwise, perhaps masculinized from {{der|es|el|γιαγιά||grandmother}}.
